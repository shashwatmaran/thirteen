            When, while the lovely girl stands before me, and her warm smile brightens the day like the meridian sun, her soft hair falling around her like a tempest of waves, and but a few stray strands brush against her face, I find myself captivated by her presence;and, as I stand close to her, every little detail of her being catches my attention: when I hear the gentle melody of her voice and become familiar with the countless, delicate expressions that play across her face, then I feel the presence of something divine, a beauty that seems to be crafted by the hand of the Almighty, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it surrounds us in a moment of pure bliss; and then, my friend, when I lose myself in her gaze, and the world around us fades into nothingness, her image dwelling in my soul and filling it with a power as intense and consuming as the love for a beloved, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these emotions, could capture on paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of this infinite love!</p></div>

            Language is a poor translation of human emotions.No entity is capable of articulating their emtotions as they feel it.It is like asking pigs to enact a shakespere play.Bad example,it's more like trying to paint a sunset but with only one colour- or describing a symphony with only one note. No matter how eloquent or rich our vernacular palete may be, there's always something lost in the tranlation from emotion to language.The richness of our experience often exceed the limits of words, leaving us with expressions that can only hint att he deeper truths we carry within</p>

            <p>However it is the pursuit of conveying ones thoughts which bridges the gap. So kind reader, please don't mind when one reiterates their feelings.Yes at times, it might seem like adding sugar to jaggery, but I promise you it is but a cup of the latter's soul for you take a sip from.</p>

        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">How dare you</span><p><span class="headline hl2">why art thou?    </span></p></div>How can you be so damn aware of it? You stand there with that willowy, effortless grace, fully knowing the effect you have on everyone around you. It’s maddening, watching you move through life, owning every room you walk into, as if you were born to be admired.Your slender frame, so perfectly balanced, moves with a fluidity that demands attention. Every step you take is calculated, every gesture deliberate, as if you know exactly how to draw eyes to those long, graceful limbs of yours. You’re fully aware of how your body flows, how it captivates without trying too hard.</p>

            <p>You think I don’t notice how you use it, how you wield that beauty like a weapon, knowing exactly the kind of chaos you can stir up. You know every glance you throw, every smile you flash, is a effortless calibrated move in a game you’ve mastered. You stand there, so striking, so infuriatingly aware of your allure, and it drives me insane. How can you carry that beauty so boldly, knowing exactly the power you hold? How can you be so beautiful and so completely in control of it?</p></div>
        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">The buzz of your world </span><p><span class="headline hl4">A thousand unsaid thoughts    </span></p></div><p>Hearing about your world feels like a privilege, like I’m being invited into a secret garden that only you can show me. Your perspective, your passions, the little things that make up your daily life—they all mean so much to me. It’s not just about the stories you tell, but the way you share them, with such warmth and sincerity. It’s a gift I cherish deeply, what I treasure the most. You will never tire me, spending time with you feels like standing in a sunlit cathedral -you being the stained glass, where every glance,every word you share,adds a vibrant hue to my life. You make my day tolerable, you're my favourite notification ,talking to you until you fall asleep is my only respite.</p></div>
